## Setup

1. Make sure you have [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) installed
    1. Conda is a package manager that sandboxes your projectâ€™s dependencies in a virtual environment
    2. Miniconda contains Conda and its dependencies with no extra packages by default (as opposed to Anaconda, which installs some extra packages)

2.  run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    1. This creates a Conda environment called `opensea`

3. Run `conda activate opensea`
    1. This activates the `opensea` environment
    2. Do this each time you want to write/test your code
